# Behavioral Cloning Project

Using deep learning and transfer learning!

This is my fourth project in the Udacity Nanodegree program [Self-Driving Car Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

The project contains the following five important files:
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file
* video.mp4 (a video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)


## The Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report
